/* kbd.h — the southbridge's key events, from core 1 to core 0 (design.md
 * §9.1).
 *
 * Core 1 owns the I2C bus and drains the MCU's FIFO; core 0 runs the
 * engine and turns the events into the engine's (keymap.h). Between them
 * is a single-producer, single-consumer ring of the MCU's own [state,
 * code] pairs, each with the time core 1 read it, so neither core waits
 * on the other and the latency to the engine can be measured.
 *
 * In the development build, core 1 also turns bytes received on UART0
 * into events in the same ring (§14.1), so a script can drive the
 * selector and the games with nobody at the keyboard:
 *
 *   0x20-0x7E      that key, pressed and released
 *   CR or LF       Enter          BS or DEL   Backspace
 *   HT             Tab            ESC         Esc
 *   0x01 s c       one FIFO event as the MCU would send it, state s
 *                  (1 pressed, 2 held, 3 released) and code c: arrows,
 *                  function keys, modifiers held across other keys
 *   0x02           restart the program, as a card change does, to test
 *                  that path (kbd_uart_restart)
 *
 * scripts/keys.sh names them. From pico-oric's kbd.c (D6), with the
 * timestamps added and one ring, since both producers are on core 1.
