/* log.h — stdio into a ring that core 1 drains to UART0 (design.md §14.2;
 * EL §2.3).
 *
 * At 115200 baud the UART takes about 11.5 bytes a millisecond, and
 * upstream prints a great deal, some of it on timing-sensitive paths. So
 * stdio does not block on the UART: it is a stdio_driver_t that copies
 * into a ring, and core 1, which polls anyway, moves bytes into the UART
 * FIFO as it has room. Until core 1 runs, the driver writes the UART
 * directly, so a boot that dies early still has its banner.
 *
 * Either core may print, and core 0's interrupts as well: writers take a
 * hardware spin lock for the copy, which is short. A write that does not
 * fit is dropped whole and counted.
 *
 * A build without the UART (PICOCALC_QUEST_UART=0, the one that ships)
 * has nowhere to log: log_init registers nothing, and stdio discards.
