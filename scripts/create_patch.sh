# create_patch.sh — patches/frank-quest.patch from working/ (design.md §5.2).
#
#   scripts/create_patch.sh
#
# Every file under working/ is diffed against the same path under
# modules/frank-quest/, in sorted order, labelled a/<path> and b/<path>
# with no timestamps, so the same working/ always gives the same patch.
# Adding a file to the patch is copying it into working/. A file with no
# upstream counterpart is refused: new code goes in picocalc/ (§5.2,
# rule 3). So is a working/ with .rej files left in it.
#
# --upstream DIR, --working DIR and --patch FILE override the defaults.
