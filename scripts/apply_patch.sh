#   scripts/apply_patch.sh             # frank-quest/: all of upstream, patched
#   scripts/apply_patch.sh --working   # working/: only the files the patch
#                                      # edits, patched, ready to edit
#
# The first is the build's copy; CMake runs it at configure time when the
# patch or the submodule's commit has changed. The second is where upstream
# files are edited: after a submodule bump, run it, fix any rejects (left
# beside their file as .rej), then run create_patch.sh.
#
# --working refuses a working/ that already has files in it, since those
# are edits not yet in the patch; --force discards them. --upstream DIR,
# --out DIR and --patch FILE override the defaults. Exits 1 if a hunk is
# rejected.
